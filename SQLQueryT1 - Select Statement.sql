-- WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING

-- 1. WHERE clause specifies search conditions for the rows returned by the Query and limits rows to a meaningful set.

-- 2. GROUP BY clause works on the rows returned by the previous step #1. This clause summaries identical rows into a single/distinct group and returns a single row with the summary for each group, by using appropriate Aggregate function in the SELECT list, like COUNT(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), AVG(), etc.

-- 3. HAVING clause works as a Filter on top of the Grouped rows returned by the previous step #2. This clause cannot be replaced by a WHERE clause and vice-versa.

-- As these clauses are optional thus a minimal SQL Query looks like this:
--

	SELECT count(*) CountOfRecords, SafetyStockLevel
	FROM Production.Product
	Where (ProductNumber  Like 'B%' or ProductNumber  Like 'C%' )
	and  SafetyStockLevel > 100
	GROUP BY 
	SafetyStockLevel
	HAVING SafetyStockLevel = 500


	SELECT count(*) as CountOfRecords, count(ProductNumber) as CountOfRecordsPN,  SafetyStockLevel
	FROM Production.Product
	Where (ProductNumber  Like 'B%' or ProductNumber  Like 'C%' )
	and  SafetyStockLevel > 100
	GROUP BY 
	SafetyStockLevel
	HAVING count(ProductNumber) = 3 OR SafetyStockLevel = 500 OR count(*) = 6
